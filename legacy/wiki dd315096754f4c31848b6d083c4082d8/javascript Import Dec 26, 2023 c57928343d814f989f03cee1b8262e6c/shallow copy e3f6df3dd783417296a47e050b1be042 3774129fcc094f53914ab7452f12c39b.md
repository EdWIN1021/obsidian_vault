# shallow copy

- A shallow copy of an object creates a new object, but it does not create copies of nested objects within the original object.
- Instead, it copies references to the nested objects. This means that changes made to the nested objects in the copied structure will also affect the original structure, and vice versa.
- Shallow copy methods are usually quicker and require less memory because they donâ€™t duplicate the entire structure.
