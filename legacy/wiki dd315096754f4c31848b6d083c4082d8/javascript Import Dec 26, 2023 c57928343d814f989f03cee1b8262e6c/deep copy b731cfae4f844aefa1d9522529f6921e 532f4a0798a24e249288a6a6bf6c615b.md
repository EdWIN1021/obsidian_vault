# deep copy

Owner: edwin S

- A deep copy of an object creates a completely new copy of the entire object structure, including all nested objects. It does not share references with the original object.
- Changes made to the copied structure will not affect the original, and vice versa. Deep copies are often used when you need to create independent copies of complex data structures.
- Deep copy methods are generally slower and consume more memory because they recursively copy all nested structures.
- Deep copying can be implemented manually using recursion or by using specialized libraries or functions depending on the programming language.

```jsx
const original = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const deepCopy = _.cloneDeep(original); // lodash
```
