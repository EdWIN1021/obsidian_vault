### Abstraction

- Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors an object should have, while hiding the unnecessary details.

### Encapsulation

- Keeping properties and methods private in inside the class, so they are not accessible from outside the class.

### Inheritance

- Making all properties and methods of a certain class available to child class.

### Polymorphism

- A child class can overwrite a method it inherited from a parent class.

### Prototypal Inheritance

- The prototype contains methods that are accessible to objects linked to that prototype.

### Static Method

- static methods are methods that are associated with a class rather than an instance of the class
- Static methods are often used for utility functions that are related to the class but don't depend on a particular instance of the class.
